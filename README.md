# Book Review Project

This is my first project React
You can find information about my reading list, I'll leave some review rating and various information
It was quite challenging as it was my first project but learnt a lot about useState, useRef, toggling on React, maping through an [] in an {} in an []
Everything is dynamic! Because dynamic is chic! Every btns, etc
Hell Yay!

### `App`

Include most of my useState and some filtering fct

### `Navbar`

Some problem with creating a fct with parameter in there as you can see in this component
I didn't use react router for the link but scroolIntoView

### `Book`

Render the different books

### `Surprise`

Weird name but this component is use to display the genres and authors btns
I used 2 methods to toggle these 2 btns, one by using ! the other one using useRef
I also used ternary operator

### `Buttons`

use to display the genres btns

### `Authors`

use to display the authors btns
